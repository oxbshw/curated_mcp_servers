<p align="center"><strong>Discover trending and innovative Model Context Protocol servers</strong></p>

A polished and curated collection of **Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers** selected from several open‑source repositories.  This project consolidates servers into meaningful categories, making it easy to discover, explore and experiment with MCP servers.  The list is curated rather than exhaustive and aims to highlight representative, innovative and useful servers across diverse domains.

> **Tip:** If you find this list helpful, please consider starring the repository to help others discover it! Stars and shares help make the project more visible in the community.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that allows AI models to securely interact with local and remote resources through standardized server implementations. MCP servers provide the tooling and infrastructure to extend AI capabilities with file access, database connections, API integrations, and more.
